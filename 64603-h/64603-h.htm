<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>CHAPTER
I.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was considerably after midnight
when one of three officers seated at a whist-table in the
mess-room of the Cavalry Barracks at Idleminster, where the
Scarlet Lancers were quartered, called out, &ldquo;Bootles, come
and take a hand&mdash;there&rsquo;s a good chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Algernon Ferrers, more commonly known as
&ldquo;Bootles,&rdquo; looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do,&rdquo; he said, rising and
moving towards them.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you want me to
do?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s my partner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three other men stared at one another in surprise, for
Bootles was one of the best whist-players in the regiment, and in
an ordinary way would as soon have thought of counting honors as
of settling the questions of partners other than by cutting,
except in the case of a revenge.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;Why, take a card, of course, my friend,&rdquo;
laughed Lacy, in a ridiculously soft voice.&nbsp; Lacy was a
recent importation from the White Dragoons, and had taken
possession of the place left vacant in Bootles&rsquo;s every-day
life by Scott Laurie&rsquo;s marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; to be sure&mdash;cut, of course.&nbsp; I
believe,&rdquo; said Bootles, looking at the three faces before
him in an uncertain way&mdash;&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve got a
headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing like whist for a headache,&rdquo; answered
Hartog, turning up the last card.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ace of
diamonds.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, after stumbling through one
game&mdash;after twice trumping his partner&rsquo;s trick, a
revoke, and several such like blunders&mdash;he rose to his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, you fellows; I&rsquo;m no good
to-night&mdash;I can&rsquo;t even see the cards.&nbsp; Get some
one to take my place and make a fresh start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re ill, Bootles,&rdquo; cried
Preston.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a devil of a headache,&rdquo; answered
Bootles, promptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Miles&mdash;the very
man.&nbsp; Goodnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; called the fellows after him.&nbsp;
Then they settled down to their game, and Preston dealt.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>&ldquo;Never saw Bootles seedy before,&rdquo; said
Lacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; he gets these headaches sometimes,&rdquo;
answered Hartog.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not often, though.&nbsp; Miles,
your lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime Bootles went wearily away, almost feeling his road
under the veranda of the mess-rooms, along the broad
<i>pav&eacute;</i> in front of the officers&rsquo; quarters, and
up the wide flight of stone steps to his rooms facing the green
of the barrack square.&nbsp; Being the senior captain, with only
one bachelor field-officer in the regiment, he had two large and
pleasant rooms, not very grandly furnished, for, though a rich
man, he was not an extravagant one, and saw no fun in having
costly goods and chattels to be at the tender mercies of soldier
servants; but they were neat, clean, and comfortable, with a
sufficiency of great easy travelling-chairs, plenty of fur rugs,
and lots of pretty little pictures and knickknacks.</p>
<p>The fire in his sitting-room was fast dying out, but a bright
and cheerful blaze illumined his sleeping-room, shining on the
brass knobs of his cot, on the silver ornamentations at the
corners of his dressing-case, on three or four scent bottles on
the tall cretonne-petticoated toilette table, and on the tired
but resplendent figure of Bootles himself.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>He
dragged the big chair pretty near to the fire, and dropped into
it with a sigh of relief, absolutely too sick and weary to think
about getting into bed just then.&nbsp; As Hartog had said,
sometimes these headaches seized him, but it did not happen
often; in fact, he had not had one for more than a
year&mdash;quite often enough, he said.</p>
<p>Well, he had been lying in the big and easy chair, his eyes
shut and his hands hanging idly over the broad straps which
served for arms, for perhaps half an hour, when to his surprise
he heard a soft rustling movement behind him.&nbsp; His first and
not unnatural thought was that the fellows had come to draw him,
so, without moving, he called out, &ldquo;Oh! confound it all,
don&rsquo;t come boring a poor devil with a headache.&nbsp; By
Jove, it&rsquo;s cruelty to animals, neither more nor
less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soft rustling ceased, and Bootles closed his eyes again,
with a devout prayer that they would, in response to this appeal,
take themselves off.&nbsp; But presently it began again,
accompanied by a sound which made his heart jump almost into his
mouth, and beat so furiously as to be simply suffocating.&nbsp;
It stopped&mdash;was
repeated&mdash;&ldquo;<i>The</i>&mdash;DEVIL,&rdquo; muttered
Bootles.</p>
<p>But it was not the devil at all&mdash;more like a <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>little angel,
in truth; for after a moment&rsquo;s irresolution he sprang from
his chair and faced the horror behind him.&nbsp; It really was a
horror to him, for there, sitting up among the pillows of the
cot, with the clothes pushed back, was a baby, a baby whose short
golden curls shone in the fire-light&mdash;a little child dressed
in white, with a pair of wide-open, wondering eyes, as bright as
stars and as blue as sapphires.</p>
<p>Bootles stood in dismay staring at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, in the name of all that&rsquo;s wonderful, did
<i>you</i> come from?&rdquo; he asked aloud, keeping at a safe
distance lest it should suddenly start howling.</p>
<p>But the little stranger did not howl; on the contrary, as its
bewildered eyes fell upon Bootles&rsquo;s resplendent figure, his
gold-laced scarlet jacket and gold-embroidered waistcoat of white
velvet, his gold-laced overalls and jingling spurs, it stretched
out its little arms and cried, &ldquo;Boo, boo,
boo&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bootles took a step back in his surprise, and his headache
vanished as if by magic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By&mdash;Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo&mdash;boo&mdash;boo!&rdquo; crowed the usurper of
the cot, cheerily.</p>
<p>Bootles went a step nearer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re a
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>queer little
beggar,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where did you come from,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;queer little beggar&rdquo; suddenly changed its
tone, and started another system of crowing more triumphant and
cheery than the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chucka&mdash;chucka&mdash;chucka&mdash;chuck!&rdquo; it
went.</p>
<p>Bootles began to laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t talk,
hey?&nbsp; Well, what do you want?&rdquo; as it struggled
fiercely to rise, and stretched out its small arms more
impatiently than before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Want to be lifted up,
hey?&nbsp; Oh, but dash it,&rdquo; scratching his head
perplexedly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t lift you up, you know;
it&rsquo;s out of the question&mdash;impossible.&nbsp; By Jove, I
might let you drop and smash you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chucka&mdash;chucka&mdash;chucka!&nbsp;
Boo&mdash;oo&mdash;oo!&rdquo; gobbled the baby, as if it were the
best joke in the world.</p>
<p>Bootles positively roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind?&nbsp; Well, come along,
then,&rdquo; approaching very gingerly, and wondering where he
should begin to get hold of it, so to speak.</p>
<p>The baby soon settled that question, holding out its arms
towards his neck.&nbsp; Then somehow he gathered it up and
carried it in doubt and trepidation to the big chair by the fire,
where the creature sat contentedly upon his knee, the curly
golden <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>head
resting against his scarlet jacket, the soft fingers of one baby
hand tight twined round one of his, the other picking and
wandering aimlessly about the scrolls and curves of the gold
embroidery on his waistcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! you&rsquo;re a jolly little chap,&rdquo; said
Bootles, just as if it could understand him.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the
question is, where did you come from, and what&rsquo;s to be done
with you?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t stop here, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The babe&rsquo;s big blue eyes raised themselves to his, and
the fingers which had been twined round his made a grab at his
watch-chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gar&mdash;gar&mdash;garr&mdash;rah!&rdquo; it remarked,
in such evident delight that Bootles laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you like it, do you?&nbsp; Well, you&rsquo;re a
queer little beggar; no mistake about that.&nbsp; I wonder whom
you belong to, and where you live when you are at home?&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t be a barrack child&mdash;too dainty-looking and not
slobbery enough.&nbsp; And this dress&rdquo;&mdash;taking hold of
the richly embroidered white skirt&mdash;&ldquo;this must have
cost a lot; and it&rsquo;s all lace too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew what embroidery cost by his own mess waistcoats and
his tunics.&nbsp; Then not only was the dress of the child of a
very costly description, but <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>its sleeves were tied up with
Cambridge blue ribbons that were evidently new, and its waist was
encircled by a broad sash of the same material and tint.&nbsp;
Altogether it was just such a child as he was occasionally called
upon to admire in the houses of his married brother officers; yet
that any lady in the regiment would lend her baby for a whole
night to a set of harum-scarum young fellows for the purpose of
playing a trick on a brother officer was manifestly absurd.&nbsp;
And besides that, Bootles was so good-natured and such a favorite
with the ladies of the regiment that he thought he knew all their
babies by sight, and he became afraid that this one was indeed a
little stranger in the land, welcome or unwelcome.</p>
<p>Yet if it was the fellows&rsquo; doing, where had they got
it?&nbsp; And if it was not the fellows&rsquo; doing, why should
any one leave a baby asleep in his cot?&nbsp; The whole thing was
inexplicable.</p>
<p>Just then the child, in playing with his chain, slipped a
little on the smooth cloth of his overalls, and Bootles, with a
&ldquo;Whoa! whoa, my lad!&rdquo; hauled it up again.&nbsp; In
doing so he felt a piece of paper rustle somewhere about the
embroidered skirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A note.&nbsp; This grows melodramatic,&rdquo; said <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Bootles,
craning his head to find it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, here we are!&nbsp;
Now we shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The note was written in a firm, large, yet thoroughly feminine
hand, and ran thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You will not absolve me from my oath of
secrecy respecting our marriage, though now that I have offended
you, I may starve or go to the work-house.&nbsp; I cannot break
my oath, though you have broken <i>all</i> yours, but I am
determined that you <i>shall</i> acknowledge your child.&nbsp; I
am going to leave her to-night in your rooms with her
clothes.&nbsp; By midnight I shall be out of the country.&nbsp; I
do this because I have obtained a good situation, and because
when I reach my destination I shall have spent my last
shilling.&nbsp; I give you fair warning, however, that if you
desert the child, or fail to acknowledge her, I will break my
oath and proclaim our marriage.&nbsp; If you engage a nurse she
will not be much trouble.&nbsp; She is a good and sweet-tempered
child, and I have called her Mary, after your dear mother.&nbsp;
Oh, how she would pity me if she could see me now!&nbsp;
Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that moment Bootles absolved &ldquo;the fellows&rdquo;
from any share in the affair; but what to do with the child he
had not the least idea.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;It is the very devil,&rdquo; he said aloud,
watching the busy fingers still playing with his chain.</p>
<p>He gathered it awkwardly in his arms, and rose to look for the
clothing spoken of in the letter.&nbsp; Yes, there it was, a
parcel of goodly size, wrapped in a stout brown paper cover, and
on the chair beside his cot lay the out-door garments of a young
child&mdash;a white coat bordered with fur, a fur-trimmed cap,
and some other things, which Bootles did not quite understand the
use of; white wool fingerless gloves (at least he did not know
what else they could be), and some longer things of the same
class, like stockings without feet.</p>
<p>Bootles shook his head bewilderingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother
means it to stop; <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; he
said, helplessly.</p>
<p>It occurred to him then that perhaps some of the fellows might
be able to make a suggestion.&nbsp; He did not know what to do
with the child for the night, nor, for the matter of that, what
to do with it for the moment.&nbsp; He had the sense not to take
it out into the chill midnight air, and when he attempted to put
it back into the cot it rebelled, clinging to his watch-chain
with might and main.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have it then,&rdquo; he said, slipping it
off.</p>
<p>The baby, pleased with the glittering toy, set up <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>a cry of
delight, and Bootles took the opportunity of slipping out.&nbsp;
He entered the anteroom with a very rueful face, finding it
pretty much as he had left it.&nbsp; Lacy was the first to catch
sight of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo, Bootles, what&rsquo;s the mat-tah?&rdquo; he
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is your head worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head?&nbsp; Oh, I forgot all about it,&rdquo;
Bootles replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, I say, I&rsquo;m in a
mess.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a baby in my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <span class="GutSmall">WHAT</span>?&rdquo; they
cried, with one voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A baby,&rdquo; repeated Bootles, dismally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al&mdash;ive?&rdquo; asked Lacy, with his head on one
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alive!&nbsp; Oh, very, very much so, and means to stop,
for it has brought its entire wardrobe and a letter of
introduction with it,&rdquo; holding the letter for any one to
take who chose.&nbsp; It was Lacy who did so, and he asked if he
should read it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; said Bootles, dropping into a chair
with a groan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps some one else will own to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Lacy read the letter in his ridiculous drawl of a voice,
and ceased amid profound
silence&mdash;&ldquo;Fa-ah-well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Bootles, finding no one seemed
inclined to speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Preston, solemnly, &ldquo;if
you want my opinion, Bootles, I think you ought to be ashamed of
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general laugh followed, but Bootles protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;s me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
nothing to do with it.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t have come to you
fellows if I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, of course not,&rdquo; returned Miles, promptly,
but with an air which raised another shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a plant,&rdquo; announced Preston, in a
tone of conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s a plant,&rdquo; cried Bootles;
&ldquo;but why in the wide world should it be planted on
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, indeed?&rdquo; echoed Miles, feelingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Bootles continued, &ldquo;some of you
know my mother, and that her name was not Mary but
Margaret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now as several of those present had known Lady Margaret
Ferrers very well, that was a strong point in favor of
Preston&rsquo;s assertion that the affair was a plant.&nbsp; The
chief question, however, was what could be done with the little
stranger for that night.&nbsp; Some woman, of course, must look
after it, but who?&nbsp; It was then after two o&rsquo;clock, and
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the lights
had been out hours ago in the married people&rsquo;s
quarters.&nbsp; Bootles did not know what to do, and said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it in your room now?&rdquo; Preston asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my cot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil you did!&nbsp; I wonder you weren&rsquo;t
frightened out of your very wits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I nearly was,&rdquo; Bootles admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see it at once?&nbsp; Was it
howling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howling?&nbsp; Not a bit of it.&nbsp; Never saw a
jollier little beggar in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; ejaculated Miles, blankly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
say, you fellows, don&rsquo;t that sound to you very much like
the proud pap&mdash;ah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows&rdquo; all laughed at this, even perplexed
Bootles, and Hartog asked a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see it directly, Bootles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; not for half an hour or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I looked at it of course.&nbsp; What would you
have done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you <i>touch</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bootles laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, by Jove, the little beggar
came to me like a bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;Great gods!&rdquo; uttered Miles, &ldquo;and you
can doubt the fatherliness of <i>that</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what an ass you are!&rdquo; returned Hartog; then,
as if by a bright inspiration, suggested, &ldquo;I say,
let&rsquo;s go and have a look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the assembled officers, five of them, trooped along
the way Bootles had stumbled over alone in the blindness of his
now forgotten headache.&nbsp; The baby was still in the cot,
contentedly playing with the watch and chain, and at the sight of
the five resplendent figures it set up a loud
&ldquo;Boo&mdash;boo&mdash;boo&mdash;ing,&rdquo; followed by a
&ldquo;Chucka&mdash;chucka&mdash;chucka&mdash;ing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Evidently it considered this was the land of Goshen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to take after its mother in its love for a
scarlet jacket,&rdquo; remarked Miles, sententiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that the child is father of the
man&mdash;seems of the woman too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bootles,&rdquo; said Lacy, gravely, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t
it very pwretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, poor little beggar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see you nurse it,&rdquo; cried Hartog.</p>
<p>So Bootles, proud of this new accomplishment, lifted the child
awkwardly in his arms, pretty much as he might have done if it
had been a sackful of eggs, and he had made a wager he
wouldn&rsquo;t break one of them.&nbsp; He carried it to the
fire.</p>

19</span>&ldquo;Just light the candles, one of you,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the image of Bootles,&rdquo; persisted
Miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t mine, except by deed of
gift,&rdquo; returned Bootles, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bootles,&rdquo; said Lacy, &ldquo;look back over your
past life&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he made a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Bootles, expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twry to think if you can twrace any likeness to some
early love, who may have marwried&mdash;or, for that matter,
<i>not</i> have marwried&mdash;some one else,
and&mdash;er&mdash;wremembering your kind heart&mdash;for you
have a dashed kind heart, Bootles, there&rsquo;s no denying
it&mdash;may have found herself hard up or too much
encumbered&mdash;for&mdash;er&mdash;you know, a babay is
sometimes an awkward addition to a lady&rsquo;s
belongings&mdash;and may have twrusted to
your&mdash;er&mdash;general&mdash;well, shall we say softness of

for&mdash;er&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Of course I see what you mean,
but I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; Lacy broke in,
&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;pewraps was not thinking so much of
<i>your</i> case as of my own.&nbsp; You see,&rdquo; appealing to
the other three, &ldquo;the advent of this&mdash;er&mdash;babay
cwreates a <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>precedent, and&mdash;er&mdash;if it should chance to
occur to my first love&mdash;it would be awkward&mdash;for me,
very awkward.&nbsp; Her name,&rdquo; plunging headlong into a
story they all knew, &ldquo;was Naomi,
and&mdash;er&mdash;she&mdash;er&mdash;in fact, jilted me for an
elephantine parson, whose reverend name was&mdash;er&mdash;Fligg,
Solomon Fligg.&nbsp; Now, if Mrs.&mdash;er&mdash;Solomon Fligg
was to take it into her head to pack up the&mdash;er&mdash;eleven
little Fliggs and send &rsquo;em to me&mdash;it would be what I
should call awkward&mdash;devilish awkward.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lacy&rsquo;s four hearers positively roared, and the baby on
Bootles&rsquo;s knee chuckled and crowed with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it understands,&rdquo; Preston laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; But it seems a jolly little chap,&rdquo;
answered Bootles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I forgot, &rsquo;tis a
girl.&nbsp; I say, I do wish you fellows would advise me what to
do.&nbsp; How can I get any one to attend to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, roll it up in the bedclothes and sleep on the
sofa.&nbsp; It will go to sleep when it&rsquo;s tired,&rdquo;
said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With its clothes on?&rdquo; said Bootles,
doubtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I rather fancy they undress babies when
they put &rsquo;em to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t advise you to try.&nbsp; Oh, it
won&rsquo;t hurt for to-night.&rdquo;</p>

23</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cab just driven up.&nbsp; I
believe it&rsquo;s the Grays.&nbsp; I saw them go out dressed
before dinner,&rdquo; said Hartog.&nbsp; The Grays were the
adjutant and his wife, who lived in barracks.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
would help you in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go and see; there&rsquo;s a good chap,&rdquo;
Bootles cried, eagerly.</p>
<p>Hartog therefore went out.&nbsp; He found that it was the
adjutant with his wife returning from a party, and to the lady he
addressed himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Gray, Bootles is in such
trouble&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In trouble?&mdash;Bootles?&mdash;Captain
Ferrers?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s got a baby,&rdquo; Hartog
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got WHAT?&rdquo; Mrs. Gray cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A baby.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been left in his rooms,
clothes and all, and Bootles don&rsquo;t know what the de&mdash;,
what in the world, I mean, to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go in and see it?&rdquo; Mrs. Gray asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would.&nbsp; Some of the others are
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, eventually Mrs. Gray carried off the little stranger to
her own quarters, and put it to bed.&nbsp; As for Bootles, he too
went to bed, but during the whole of that blessed night he never
slept a wink.</p>
<h2><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Bootles showed his face in the
mess-room the following morning he was greeted by such a volley
of chaff as would have driven a more nervous man, or one less of
a favorite than himself, to despair.&nbsp; Already the story had
gone the round of the barracks, and Bootles found the greater
part of his brother officers ready and willing to take
Miles&rsquo;s view of the affair, whether in chaff or downright
good earnest he could not say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo! Bootles, my man,&rdquo; shouted one when he
entered, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this story we hear?&nbsp; Is it
possible that Bootles&mdash;our immaculate and philanthropical
Bootles&mdash;&nbsp; Oh, Bootles! Bootles! how are the mighty
fallen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; inquired Bootles, sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it of you, Bootles; I
wouldn&rsquo;t indeed.&nbsp; Any other fellow in the
regiment&mdash;that soft-headed Lacy grinning over there, for
instance&mdash;but <i>our Bootles</i>&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He
broke off as if words could not express the volumes he <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>thought, but
found his tongue and went on again before Bootles could open his
mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our Bootles with an unacknowledged wife sworn
not to disclose her marriage&mdash;our Bootles with a
baby&mdash;our Bootles a papa!&nbsp; Oh lor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you manage better, Bootles?&rdquo;
cried another.&nbsp; &ldquo;You might have sent her an odd fiver
now and then.&nbsp; You have plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she pretty, Bootles?&rdquo; asked a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there by any chance a flaw in the marriage?&rdquo;
inquired a fourth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m a fool?&rdquo; asked Bootles,
pleasantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you it&rsquo;s a plant.&nbsp; I
know nothing about the creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just my view,&rdquo; struck in Miles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
what I said last night.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s absurd, you know, to
expect him to own it.&nbsp; No fellow would.&nbsp; Besides, does
Bootles look like the father of a fine bouncing baby that goes
&lsquo;Chucka, chucka, chuck?&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s absurd, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Bootles joined in the laugh which followed, and Miles
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing is&mdash;and it really is awkward for
Bootles&mdash;the extraordinary likeness.&nbsp; Blue eyes, golden
hair, fair complexion.&nbsp; I should say
myself&rdquo;&mdash;looking at his comrade critically,
&ldquo;that <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>at the same age Bootles was just such a baby as that
which turned up so mysteriously last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be.&nbsp; Any way, the youngster is
not mine,&rdquo; said Bootles, emphatically; &ldquo;and what to
do with the little beggar <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send it back to its mother,&rdquo; suggested
Dawson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know who the mother is,&rdquo;
Bootles answered, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; so you say.&nbsp; Well, then, the brat must have
growed, like Topsy.&nbsp; If I were you I should send it to the
police-station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police-station?&nbsp; Oh no; hang it all, the poor
little beggar has done nothing to start the world in that
way,&rdquo; Bootles answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any of you,&rdquo; asked Miles of the general
company, &ldquo;ever hear of a chap called Solomon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;did,&rdquo; answered Lacy,
promptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;His other name
was&mdash;er&mdash;Fligg.&nbsp; The Reverend Solomon
Fligg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve all heard of <i>him</i>! but I meant a
rather more celebrated person.&nbsp; There is a story about
him&mdash;I rather think it&rsquo;s in
Proverbs&rdquo;&mdash;eliciting a yell of laughter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not Proverbs?&nbsp; Well, perhaps it&rsquo;s in the Song
of Solomon.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about two mothers, who each had a
baby, and one of <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>them managed to smother hers in the night, and finding
it dead when she woke up in the morning, claimed the other
baby.&nbsp; Of course the other woman kicked up a row, a regular
shindy, and they came before Solomon to get the matter
settled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Both claim it,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, chop it in half, and let each have a
share&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; But you all know the rest.&nbsp; How
the real mother gave up her claim sooner than see the child
halved.&nbsp; Now in this case, you see, Bootles hasn&rsquo;t the
heart to send the child off to the police-station, as he would
if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the colonel,&rdquo; said some one at this
point, and in less than two seconds he appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ferrers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
hearing a queer tale about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Bootles, dismally; &ldquo;and
where it will end <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp; Here am I
saddled&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course you know whether the child has any
claim upon you&mdash;&rdquo; the colonel began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my honor it has not, colonel,&rdquo; said Bootles,
earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that, of course, settles the question,&rdquo;
replied the colonel, with a frown at the grinning faces along the
table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should send the child to the workhouse
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>&ldquo;The workhouse?&rdquo; repeated Bootles,
reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet any one a fiver he don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
murmured Miles to his neighbors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he.&nbsp; Madame la M&egrave;re knew what she was
doing when she picked out Bootles.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll get one of
the sergeants&rsquo; wives to look after it; see if he
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the chief had left the room, Bootles continued his
breakfast in silence, considering the two suggestions for the
disposal of the child.&nbsp; Now, if the truth be told, Bootles
had a horror of workhouses.&nbsp; He had gone deeply into the
&ldquo;Casual&rdquo; question, and pitied a tramp from the very
inmost recesses of his kind heart.&nbsp; It fairly made him sick
to think of that bonny golden head growing up among the shorn and
unlovely locks of a pauper brood&mdash;to think of the little
soft fingers that had twined themselves so confidently about his
own, and had picked at the embroideries of his mess waistcoat,
being slapped by the matron, or set as soon as they should be
strong enough to do coarse and hard work, to develop into the
unnaturally widened and unkempt hand of a
&ldquo;Marchioness&rdquo;&mdash;to think of that little dainty
thing being nourished on skilly, or on whatever hard fare <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>pauper
children are fed&mdash;to think of that little aristocrat being
brought up among the children of thieves and vagabonds!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, confound it all,&rdquo; he broke out, &ldquo;I
<i>can&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never expected you could,&rdquo; retorted
Miles.&nbsp; &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be natural if you
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Bootles did not laugh; on the contrary, he looked up
and regarded Miles with a grave and searching gaze, rather
disconcerting to that quizzical young gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you judging me out of your own bushel?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&nbsp; What do you mean?&rdquo; Miles
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do <i>you</i> happen to know anything of the
matter?&rdquo; Bootles persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&nbsp; Oh no.&nbsp; On my honor I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; As the colonel said just now, that settles
the question.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a very witty fellow, Miles,
very.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, after a while, if you
ain&rsquo;t quite the sharp man of the regiment.&nbsp; Only your
jokes are like the clown&rsquo;s jokes at the circus&mdash;one
gets to know them.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re in this kind of way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ever been in Paris, Mr. Lando?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, of course, Bell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ever been in Vienna, Mr. Lando?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;To be sure, Bell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ever been in Geneva, Mr. Lando?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course I have, Bell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ever been in jail, Mr. Lando?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I have, Bell&mdash;at
least&mdash;that&rsquo;s to say&mdash;I mean&mdash;no, of course
I haven&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Mr. Lando, I <i>saw</i> you
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You saw me in jail, Bell?&nbsp; And what were
you doing to see me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rsquo; grandly, &lsquo;I was staying with the
governor for the good of my &rsquo;ealth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And hadn&rsquo;t stealing a cow something to do
with it, eh, Bell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yah.&nbsp; Who stole a watch?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A Jersey cow, eh, Bell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah.&nbsp; What time is it, Mr. Lando?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just about milking time, Bell, my
friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very funny once, you know, Miles,&rdquo;
Bootles ended, disdainfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;But when you&rsquo;ve
been to the circus half a dozen times you don&rsquo;t see
anything to laugh at, somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For grace&rsquo;s sake Miles was obliged to laugh, for every
one else roared, except Bootles, who went on speaking very
gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s very amusing to make a joke of the
affair, to say I know more about it than I will <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>confess.&nbsp; I have told the colonel <i>on my
honor</i> that the child is not mine, nor do I know whose it
is.&nbsp; If it were mine I should not have made the story public
property&mdash;it&rsquo;s not in reason that I should.&nbsp; My
difficulty is what to do with it.&nbsp; The colonel suggests the
workhouse, Dawson the police-station&mdash;one simply means the
other, and I can&rsquo;t bring me to do it.&nbsp; It is an awful
thing for the child of a tramp or a thief to be reared in a
workhouse&mdash;and this is no common person&rsquo;s child.&nbsp;
For anything I know it may belong to one of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; observed a man who had
not yet taken part in the discussion, except to laugh now and
then.&nbsp; &ldquo;But remember, Bootles, if you saddle yourself
with the child you will have to go on with it.&nbsp; It will
stick to you like a burr, and though we are all ready to accept
your word of honor, the world may not be so.&nbsp; If you put the
brat out to nurse in the regiment, the story may crop up years
hence, just when you least desire or expect it; and, you know, a
story&mdash;mixed and confused by time and repetition&mdash;about
a deserted wife may come to have a very ugly sound about
it.&nbsp; Now if, as the colonel suggests, you send the child to
the workhouse, you wash your hands of the <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>whole
business.&nbsp; Then, again, if the brat is brought up in the
regiment, with the <i>disadvantage</i> of your protection, what
will she be in twenty years&rsquo; time?&nbsp; Neither fish,
flesh, nor good red herring.&nbsp; Far better the oblivion of
pauperism than the distinction among the men of being Captain
Ferrers&rsquo;s&mdash;shall we say
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a great deal in that,&rdquo; Bootles
admitted.&nbsp; He had at all times a great respect for Harkness,
and profound faith in the soundness of his judgment.&nbsp; He saw
at once that any plan of bringing the child up among the married
people of the regiment would not do, and yet&mdash;<i>the
workhouse</i>.</p>
<p>He rose from the table and settled his forage cap upon his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dare say you fellows will laugh at
me,&rdquo; he said, almost desperately, as he pulled the
chin-strap over his mustache, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t condemn
that helpless thing to the workhouse&mdash;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>,
and that&rsquo;s all about it.&nbsp; It seems to me,&rdquo; he
went on, rubbing the end of his whip on the back of a chair, and
looking at no one&mdash;&ldquo;it seems to me that the
child&rsquo;s future in this world and the next depends upon the
course I take now.&nbsp; And you may laugh at me&mdash;I dare say
you will,&rdquo; he said, quite nervously for
him&mdash;&ldquo;but I shall get a proper nurse to take charge of
it, and I shall keep it myself until some one turns up to claim
it&mdash;or&mdash;or for good.&rdquo;</p>

then officers&rsquo;-call sounded, and Bootles made a clean bolt
of it, leaving his brother officers staring amazedly at one
another.&nbsp; The first of them to make a move was
Lacy&mdash;the first, too, to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Bootles is a
devilish fine fellow; and, d&mdash; it all,&rdquo; he added,
getting very red, and scarcely drawling, in his intense rage of
admiration, &ldquo;if there were a few more fellows in the world
like him, it would be a vewry diffewrent place to what it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as Bootles had a spare
moment he made his way to the adjutant&rsquo;s quarters, where he
found Mrs. Gray playing with the mysterious baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that you, Captain Ferrers?&rdquo; she
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come and see your waif.&nbsp; She is the
dearest little thing.&nbsp; Why, I do believe she knows
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bootles whistled to the child, which promptly made a grab at
his chain, and when he sat down on the sofa on which it was
sprawling, tried very hard to get at the gold badge on his
collar.&nbsp; Shoulder badges had not then come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Gray,&rdquo; Bootles said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s very
well dressed, is she not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very,&rdquo; Mrs. Gray answered, smoothing out the
child&rsquo;s skirt so as to display the fine and deep
embroidery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unusually so.&nbsp; All its clothes are
of the finest and most expensive description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so; it doesn&rsquo;t look like a common
child, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied the lady, promptly.</p>

39</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bootles told her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been most unmercifully chaffed, which was only to be expected;
but the colonel takes my word about it, and of course the others
don&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think, though, why the
mother has chosen me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All, well, you see, Captain Ferrers,&rdquo; said the
adjutant&rsquo;s wife, with a smile, &ldquo;it is rather
inconvenient sometimes to have a character for great kindness of
heart.&nbsp; I should say you are the greatest favorite in the
regiment, and, naturally enough, the officers speak of it
sometimes in society.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Bootles is this, and
Bootles is that;&rsquo; &lsquo;Bootles wouldn&rsquo;t turn a dog
from his door;&rsquo; &lsquo;Bootles would share his last
sixpence with a poor chap who was down,&rsquo; and so on.&nbsp;
<i>I</i> have heard, Captain Ferrers, of your emptying your
pockets to divide among three poor tramps who had begged no more
than a pipe of tobacco.&nbsp; <i>I</i> have heard of your
standing up for&rdquo;&mdash;with a deeper smile&mdash;&ldquo;the
poor devils of casuals; and if I hear it, why not others? why not
the mother of this child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True.&nbsp; But I think you all overrate my
character,&rdquo; Bootles replied, modestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know I don&rsquo;t go in for being saintly at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just it.&nbsp; If you did you would have no <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>more
influence than Major Allardyce, whom every one laughs at.&nbsp;
But you don&rsquo;t; you are one of themselves, and yet you will
always help a man who is down; you will do any unfortunate
creature a good turn.&nbsp; Oh, I hear a good deal, though you
choose to make light of it.&nbsp; And you know, Captain Ferrers,
we are not told that the good Samaritan made a great spluttering
about what he did; but the professional saints, the priest and
the Levite, passed by on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very complimentary,&rdquo; Bootles said,
blushing a little; &ldquo;much more than I deserve, I&rsquo;m
sure.&nbsp; The fellows&rdquo;&mdash;laughing at the
remembrance&mdash;&ldquo;were much less merciful.&nbsp; Then
about the child.&nbsp; Dawson suggests sending it to the
police-station, the colonel to the workhouse; and one means the
other, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gray caught the child to her breast with a cry of dismay,
and Bootles went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I feel as you do about it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t do
it, and that&rsquo;s all about it.&nbsp; It would be on my
conscience all my life.&nbsp; Besides, some day the mother might
come back for it, and though of course, as the colonel says,
there is no claim upon me, yet, if for the sake of a few pounds I
had turned the poor little beggar adrift, ruined its
life&mdash;why I simply <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>couldn&rsquo;t face her, and
that&rsquo;s all about it.&nbsp; And besides that, Mrs. Gray, I
have a lurking suspicion that the letter is genuine, and that it
was not written to or intended for me.&nbsp; It reads to me like
the letter of a woman who was desperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a woman must have been desperate indeed to
willingly part with such a child as that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gray,
smoothing the gold baby curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I think, for nature is nature all the world
over,&rdquo; Bootles answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And besides, to tell
you the honest truth, there is a resemblance in the child to some
one I knew once&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, not that!&nbsp; She is dead.&nbsp; She was
engaged to a fellow I knew, desperately fond of him, and
he&mdash;jilted her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kerr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bootles stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me himself, I think to ease his mind,&rdquo;
she answered, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Well, it killed her.&nbsp; She died
heart-broken.&nbsp; I saw her,&rdquo; he said, rising and going
to the window, whence he stood staring out over the square,
&ldquo;a few hours after she died.&nbsp; That child&rsquo;s
mother may look like that now, and I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t
turn it <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>adrift, whatever the fellows or any one else chooses to
think or say, and that&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two bright tears gathered in Mrs. Gray&rsquo;s eyes, and
falling, fell upon the baby&rsquo;s curls of gold, two priceless
diamonds from the unfathomable and exhaustless mines of
pity.&nbsp; For a moment or two there was silence, broken at last
by the child&rsquo;s laugh, as a ray of sickly winter sunshine
fell upon the glittering chain in its little hands.&nbsp; The
sound recovered Bootles, who turned from the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, Mrs. Gray,&rdquo; he said, carefully avoiding
the gaze of her wet eyes, &ldquo;I have determined to keep the
little beggar; but Harkness, who&rsquo;s no fool, you know, has
convinced me that it won&rsquo;t do to trust to any of the
barrack women to look after her.&nbsp; Therefore, if you
won&rsquo;t mind undertaking it for a few days, I will advertise
for a respectable elderly nurse to take entire charge of the
creature.&nbsp; I dare say I can arrange with Smithers for an
extra room, and you&rsquo;ll let me come to you for advice now
and then, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gray rose and went close to him, laying her hand upon his
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Captain Ferrers,&rdquo; she said, earnestly,
&ldquo;you will have your reward.&nbsp; God will bless you for
this.&rdquo;</p>

45</span>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t, Mrs. Gray,&rdquo; Bootles
stammered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really I&rsquo;d rather you&rsquo;d chaff
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gray laughed outright.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you know what
my sentiments are, so for the future I will chaff you
unmercifully.&mdash;Come in,&rdquo; she added, in a louder tone,
as a &ldquo;tap-tap&rdquo; sounded on the door.</p>
<p>The permission was followed by the entrance of Lacy, who came
in with a pleasant &ldquo;Good&mdash;er&mdash;morning,&rdquo; and
a soft laugh at the sight of the baby on the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;thought old Bootles would be
here,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
besides&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;wanted to see the babay.&nbsp;
Seems to me, Bootles,&rdquo; he added, staring with an absurd air
of reflective wisdom at the infant, &ldquo;as if the face is
somehow familiar to me.&nbsp; Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean you.&nbsp;
It isn&rsquo;t a bit like you.&nbsp; But there is a likeness,
though I don&rsquo;t know where to plant it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it will grow,&rdquo; suggested Bootles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! pewraps it will, and pewraps it won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
The worst of the affair is that it is cwreating a
pwrecedent&rdquo;&mdash;not for worlds would he have admitted to
his friend that he thought him the fine fellow he had declared
him in the mess-room that morning&mdash;&ldquo;and if we are
<i>all</i> inundated with <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>babays I wreally don&rsquo;t
know&rdquo; (plaintively) &ldquo;what the wregiment will come
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gar&mdash;ah&mdash;gar&mdash;ah!&rdquo; chuckled the
subject of this speech over the gold knob at the top of
Lacy&rsquo;s whip.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cluck&mdash;cluck&mdash;cluck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little beggah seems to find it a good joke, any
way,&rdquo; Lacy cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a gwreat hand at
nursing.&nbsp; Our adjutant&rsquo;s wife in the White Dwragoons
had thwree&mdash;all at once.&nbsp; I say, Mrs. Gwray, stick
something on it, and I&rsquo;ll take it out and show it
wround.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dawre I?&nbsp; Just twry.&nbsp; By-the-bye, it&rsquo;s
cold this morning&mdash;vewry cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gray therefore fetched the child&rsquo;s white coat and
cap and those other white woollen articles, which Bootles now
discovered to be leggings, and quickly transformed the little
woman into a sort of snowball.&nbsp; The two men watched the
operation with intense interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>La figlia del wreggimento</i>,&rdquo; laughed
Lacy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare, Bootles, she&rsquo;s quite a credit
to us.&nbsp; I never saw such a <i>petite
mademoiselle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bootles started.&nbsp; It reminded him who had been jilted by
his friend and died for love.&nbsp; He had always called her
Mademoiselle Mignon.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Mignon,&rdquo; he said, carelessly;
&ldquo;not a bad name for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vewry good,&rdquo; returned Lacy, preparing to present
arms.</p>
<p>He proved himself a much better nurse than Bootles.&nbsp; He
gathered the child on his left arm and marched off to the
anteroom, in front of which the officers were standing about,
waiting for church.&nbsp; They set up a shout at the sight of
him, and crowded round to inspect the new importation.&nbsp;
Mademoiselle Mignon bore the inspection calmly, conscious
perhaps&mdash;as she was such a knowing little person&mdash;of
the effect of her big, blue, star-like eyes under the white fur
of her cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity she ain&rsquo;t twenty years older!&rdquo;
was the first comment, and it was said in such a tone of genuine
regret that all the fellows laughed again.&nbsp; Miss Mignon
gobbled with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems a jolly little beggar,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chut&mdash;chut&mdash;chut!&rdquo; remarked Miss
Mignon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw such a jolly little beggar in all my
life,&rdquo; asserted another voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty work she&rsquo;ll make in the regiment sixteen
or seventeen years hence,&rdquo; grumbled old Garnet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, nevah mind, Garnet&mdash;nevah you <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>mind, Major
Garnet, sir,&rdquo; cried Hartog, &ldquo;we shall all be dead by
then;&rdquo; but this being an exceedingly old and threadbare
regimental joke was instantly snubbed in the face of the new and
substantial one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it any teeth?&rdquo; demanded Miles, the orderly
officer for the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Open your mouth, little
one,&rdquo; said Lacy, gravely.</p>
<p>At this point Miss Mignon made a delighted lunge in the
direction of the belt across Miles&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp; Lacy
shouted, &ldquo;Whoa, whoa,&rdquo; and Miles immediately backed
out of reach.&nbsp; Miss Mignon&rsquo;s mouth went dismally down,
until Lacy remembered the knob of his whip, and held it up for
delectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo&mdash;boo!&rdquo; she crowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&nbsp; She can half say Bootles already,&rdquo;
ejaculated Hartog.&nbsp; &ldquo;And here he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; Bootles called out, &ldquo;have any
of you fellows made up your mind to own this little
baggage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; none of us,&rdquo; they laughed; but one man,
Gilchrist by name, said, with a sneer, he should rather think
not, and added two unnecessary words&mdash;&ldquo;<i>workhouse
brat</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Bootles
turned, and looked down upon him in profoundest contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear chap,&rdquo; he said, coolly, &ldquo;to charge
<i>you</i> with being the father of <i>that</i> child,&rdquo;
pointing with his whip to the picture in Lacy&rsquo;s arms,
&ldquo;would be a compliment on your personal appearance which I
should never, under any circumstances, have dreamed of paying
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is,&rdquo; said Hartog
afterwards to Lacy, &ldquo;Bootles is a dashed good
fellow&mdash;one of the best fellows in the world.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s another I&rsquo;d trust as
far or as thoroughly; but all the same, Bootles is sometimes best
left alone, and, for my part, I think Gilchrist and every one
else had best leave him alone about this youngster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya&mdash;as,&rdquo; returned Lacy; then began to
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! but it was fine, though, about
&lsquo;personal appearance.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he
added, &ldquo;Ugly little beast!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not to be expected, and
Bootles did not expect it, that the story of the mysterious
little stranger could be confined to barracks.&nbsp; In fact, in
the course of a few hours it had flown all over the town, gaining
additions and alterations by the frequency of its repetition,
until at last Bootles himself could hardly recognize it.&nbsp; A
baby had been found in Captain Ferrers&rsquo;s rooms; no one knew
where it had come from nor to whom it belonged.&nbsp;
Then&mdash;Captain Ferrers had rescued a young baby from a brutal
father who was going to dash its brains out against the
door-post.&nbsp; Then&mdash;Captain Ferrers had picked up a
new-born infant while hunting with the duke&rsquo;s hounds.&nbsp;
Then&mdash;Captain Ferrers was suffering from mental aberration,
or, to speak plainly, was getting a bit cracked, and had adopted
a child a year old out of Idleminster workhouse.&nbsp;
Then&mdash;It was really most romantic, but Captain Ferrers had
been engaged to and jilted by a young lady long <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>ago&mdash;which, of course, accounted for his being
impervious to the fascinations of the Idleminster girls&mdash;who
had married, been deserted by her husband, and now
died&mdash;some versions of the story said &ldquo;committed
suicide&rdquo;&mdash;leaving him the charge of a baby, etc.</p>
<p>Some people told one version of the story and some people told
another, but nobody blamed Bootles very much.&nbsp; It might be
because he was so rich and so handsome and pleasant; it might be
because Idleminster society was free from that leaven of
censoriousness which causes most people to look at most things
from the worst possible view.</p>
<p>But Bootles went on his serene way, telling the true state of
the case to every one who mentioned the affair to him, and always
ending, &ldquo;And hang it, you know, it&rsquo;s a pretty little
beggar, and I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> send it to the
workhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made no secret about it at all, and on the Saturday
following the advent of the child an advertisement appeared in
the Idleminster <i>Chronicle</i> which made Idleminster tongues
clack for a week:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Wanted</i>, <i>immediately</i>, <i>a
highly respectable and thoroughly experienced nurse of middle
age</i>, <i>to </i><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span><i>take the entire charge of a child about a year
old</i>.&nbsp; <i>Good wages to a suitable person</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Apply to Captain Ferrers</i>, <i>Scarlet
Lancers</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In due time this advertisement produced the right sort of
person, and a staid and respectable widow of about fifty was soon
installed in a room next to Mr. Gray&rsquo;s quarters, in charge
of Miss Mignon, as the child had already come to be called by
everybody.</p>
<p>It was a charming child&mdash;strong and healthy, seemed to
have no trouble with temper or teeth, hardly ever cried, and
might be seen morning and afternoon being wheeled by its nurse in
a baby-carriage about the barrack square or along the road
outside the Broad Arrow boundaries.&nbsp; And so, as the weeks
rolled by and wore into months, it began to toddle about, and
could say &ldquo;Bootles&rdquo; as plain as a pike-staff.</p>
<p>In April the Scarlet Lancers were moved from Idleminster to
Blankhampton, where Bootles had to undergo a new experience, for
every one there took him for a widower on account of the
child.</p>
<p>Bootles would explain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take her about with
me?&nbsp; Yes; she likes it.&nbsp; Always wants to go when she
sees the trap.&nbsp; A bother?&nbsp; Not a bit of it; the
jolliest little woman in creation, and <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>as good as gold.&nbsp; What am I
going to do with her when she grows up?&nbsp; Well, Lacy says he
is going to marry her.&nbsp; If he don&rsquo;t, somebody else
will&mdash;no fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking it all round, Miss Mignon had a remarkably good time of
it, and seemed thoroughly to appreciate the pleasant places in
which her lines had fallen.&nbsp; It was wonderful, too, what an
immense favorite she was with &ldquo;the fellows.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
first she had been &ldquo;Bootles&rsquo;s brat,&rdquo; but very
soon that was dropped, and by the time she could toddle, which
she did in very good time, no one thought of mentioning her or of
speaking to her except as &ldquo;Miss Mignon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Scarcely any of the officers dreamed for a moment of returning
after a few days&rsquo; leave without &ldquo;taking along,&rdquo;
as the Americans say, a box of sweets or a bundle of toys for
Miss Mignon.&nbsp; Indeed the young lady came to have such a
collection that after a while Mrs. Nurse&rsquo;s patient soul
arose, and with Captain Ferrers&rsquo;s permission all the
discarded ones were distributed among the less fortunate children
of the regiment.</p>
<p>But Miss Mignon&rsquo;s favorite plaything was Bootles
himself&mdash;after Bootles, Lacy.&nbsp; People said it was
wonderful, the depth of the affection between <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>the big
soldier of thirty-five and the little dot of a child, scarcely
two.&nbsp; Bootles she adored, and where Bootles was she would
be, if by hook or by crook she could convey her small person into
his presence.&nbsp; Once she spied him turn in at the gates on
the right hand of the colonel, when the regiment was returning
from a field-day, and escaping from her nurse&rsquo;s hand, set
off as hard as she could run in the direction of the band, which
immediately preceded the commanding officer.&nbsp; Mrs. Nurse
gave chase, but alas! Mrs. Nurse was stout, and had the ill luck,
moreover, to come a cropper over a drain tile lying conveniently
in her way, while the child, unconscious of danger, ran straight
for Bootles.&nbsp; Neither Bootles nor Lacy, who was on the
colonel&rsquo;s left, perceived her until she was close upon
them, waving her small hands, and shouting, in her shrill and
joyous child&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;Bootles!&nbsp;
Bootles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Bootles, as be looked past the colonel, that the
child was almost under the hoofs of Lacy&rsquo;s charger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lacy!&rdquo; he called out&mdash;&ldquo;Lacy!&rdquo;&nbsp;
But Lacy was already on the ground, and caught Miss Mignon out of
harm&rsquo;s way; but when he turned round he saw that his
friend&rsquo;s face was as white as chalk.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>As for
the colonel, when he saw Mrs. Nurse gathering herself up with
rueful looks at the drain tile, he simply roared, and Miss Mignon
chimed in as if it were the finest joke in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a smash,&rdquo; she remarked, from her proud
position on Lacy&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;just like Humpty
Dumpty&rdquo;&mdash;a comment which gave that estimable person
the name of Mrs. Humpty Dumpty as long as she remained with the
regiment.</p>
<p>A few weeks after this the annual inspection came off, and
Miss Mignon, resenting the lengthened absence of her Bootles,
again managed to escape from her nurse, and pattered boldly, as
fast as her small feet would carry her, right into the mess-room,
where Bootles was sitting, just opposite the general, at the late
lunch.&nbsp; Miss Mignon not seeing him at first, wandered coolly
behind the row of scarlet-clad backs, until she spied him at the
other side of the table.&nbsp; Then, having no awe whatever of
inspecting officers, she wedged herself in between his chair and
the colonel&rsquo;s with a triumphant and joyous laugh.</p>
<p>The general gave a great start, and the colonel laughed.&nbsp;
Bootles, in dismay, jumped up, and came quickly round the table
to take her away.</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&ldquo;Well, you little rogue,&rdquo; said the colonel,
reaching a nectarine for her.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted Bootles, sir,&rdquo; said Miss Mignon,
confidentially.&nbsp; &ldquo;And nurse falled asleep, so I tooked
French leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; Almost the only peculiarity in her
speech was the habit of making all verbs regular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are you, my little maid?&rdquo; the general
asked, in extreme amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m Miss Mignon,&rdquo; with dignity.</p>
<p>The old general fairly chuckled with delight, and as he had
put his arm round the child, Bootles, who was standing behind,
could not very well take her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Mignon&mdash;hey?&nbsp; And whom do you belong
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to Bootles,&rdquo; in surprise at his
ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Bootles?&nbsp; And who is Bootles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bootles is Bootles, and I love him,&rdquo; Miss Mignon
replied, as if that settled everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy Bootles!&rdquo; cried the old soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lot of medals you&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo; cried
Miss Mignon, pressing closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, sir, she is troubling you,&rdquo;
Bootles interposed at this point, but secretly delighted with the
turn affairs had taken.</p>

61</span>&ldquo;No, no; let her see my medals,&rdquo; replied the
general, who was as proud of his medals as Bootles of Miss
Mignon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a &lsquo;sir&rsquo; too?&rdquo; Miss Mignon
asked, gazing at the handsome old man with more respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does she mean?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Bootles laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, she hears us speak to the colonel so, that
is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&nbsp; What a remarkably intelligent and
attractive child!&rdquo; exclaimed the general, quietly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How old is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it happened that the old general had a craze for absolute
accuracy, and he caught Bootles up with pleasant sharpness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Does that mean more or less?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, sir.&nbsp; She is about two.&nbsp; I
do not know the date of her birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she is not yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not her father, sir, but at present she belongs to
me,&rdquo; Bootles said, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, but perhaps she had better go.&nbsp; What a
charming child!&rdquo;&nbsp; This last was perhaps <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>because Miss
Mignon, finding her time had come&mdash;and she never made a fuss
on such occasions&mdash;put two soft arms round his neck, and
gave him such a genuine hug of friendship that the old
man&rsquo;s heart was quite taken by storm.</p>
<p>So Miss Mignon was carried off, looking back to the last over
Bootles&rsquo;s shoulder, and waving her adieu to the handsome
old man, who had such a fascinating array of clasps and
medals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite understand&mdash;what relation is
the child to him?&rdquo; he asked of the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever.&nbsp; Ferrers found her late one night
in his bed, with her wardrobe, and a letter from the mother,
written as if Ferrers was the father.&nbsp; He, however, gave me
his word of honor that he knew nothing about it, and some of us
think the whole affair was simply a plant, as he is known to be a
very kind-hearted fellow.&nbsp; Others, however, Ferrers among
them, think that note and child were intended for one of the
others.&nbsp; Nobody, however, would own to it, and Ferrers has
kept the child ever since&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose he would
part with her now for anything.&nbsp; I wanted him to send her to
the workhouse, but &rsquo;tis a jolly bright little soul, and I
am glad he did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is not married?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>&ldquo;Oh dear no.&nbsp; He pays a woman fifty pounds a
year to look after her, and all her meals go from the mess.&nbsp;
In fact, he is bringing her up as if she were his own; and the
child adores him&mdash;simply adores him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I respect that man,&rdquo; said the general,
warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is an awful thing for a child to be
reared in a workhouse&mdash;awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Bootles feels very strongly on the subject,&rdquo;
replied the colonel, absently.</p>
<p>By the time Bootles returned, the officers had risen from the
table, and he met the guests and the seniors just entering the
anteroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shake hands with you, Captain Ferrers, if
you please,&rdquo; said the general, cordially.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
agree with you that it is an awful thing for a child to be
brought up in a workhouse.&nbsp; It is a subject upon which I
feel very strongly&mdash;very strongly.&nbsp; A child reared as a
pauper does not start the world with a fair chance.&nbsp; I have
met so often, in the course of my military experience, with
recruits bred in the Unions&mdash;I never knew one do well.&nbsp;
No; pauperism is ground into them, and they are never able to
shake it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, that is my opinion,&rdquo; said Bootles,
modestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope, though, you won&rsquo;t think my
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>little
maid is often so obtrusive as to-day.&nbsp; She is really always
very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A charming little child,&rdquo; replied the general, as
if he meant it too, and then he shook hands with Bootles
again.</p>
<h2><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was only one blot in the
sweetness and light of Miss Mignon&rsquo;s baby character, so far
as the officers of the Scarlet Lancers were concerned.&nbsp;
Among them all there was only one whom she did not like.&nbsp;
She had degrees of love&mdash;Bootles ranked first, then Lacy,
then two or three groups of friends whom she liked best, better,
and well; but she had no degrees of dislike where she did not
love.&nbsp; She hated, hated fiercely and furiously, hated with
all her baby heart and soul.&nbsp; There were several persons in
her small world whom she detested thus, absolutely declining to
hold communication or to accept overtures from them, however
sweetly made; but there was only one of the officers who came
under this head, and he was Gilchrist, the man who had dubbed her
at first <i>workhouse brat</i>.&nbsp; Miss Mignon could not
endure him.&nbsp; When old enough to understand that a certain
box of sweeties had come from Mr. Gilchrist, she would drop it as
if it burned her fingers, draw <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>down the corners of her mouth, and
remark, &ldquo;Miss Mignon is very much obliged;&rdquo; an
observation which invariably sent Bootles and Lacy off into fits
of laughter, at which the little maid would fly open-armed to
him, and cry, &ldquo;But Mignon <i>loves</i>
Bootles.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the fact remained the same, that Miss
Mignon detested Gilchrist, who, indeed, was not a favorite in the
regiment.&nbsp; Nor, indeed, did Gilchrist seem to like Miss
Mignon any better, though he now and then brought his offerings
of toys and bonbons like the rest.&nbsp; In the face of
Bootles&rsquo;s severe snub about the two odious words he had
applied to her, he was hardly such a simpleton as to further
rouse or annoy the most popular man in the regiment; yet if he
could possibly cast a slur on Bootles or on the child he did
it.&nbsp; Never from his lips came the pet name &ldquo;Miss
Mignon,&rdquo; never did his black eyes rest on her without a
sneer or a jibe; if he could by any chance twist Bootles&rsquo;s
words into an admission that the child was really his, he took
care never to lose the opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, now,&rdquo; Preston cried one day, when he
had been sneering at Bootles and Lacy, who had just driven away
with the child between them, &ldquo;Bootles is a right good
sort&mdash;no mistake on that <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>point.&nbsp; No sneaking hypocrisy
about him.&nbsp; It would be well for you and me if we were half
as fine chaps; but we are not, Gilchrist, and, what is more, we
never shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; but where is the mother of that brat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know? or Bootles?&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t
mind laying my life that Bootles never did and never will cause
her or any other woman to write such a letter as came with the
child that night.&nbsp; Jolly good thing for this one if she was
Bootles&rsquo;s wife, instead of being tied up to the hound who
bound her to secrecy and deserted her.&nbsp; Perhaps she&rsquo;s
dead, poor soul!&nbsp; Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Gilchrist
sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some people never die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good-natured and not very wise Preston stared at him, and
Hartog looked from behind his newspaper, aghast at the bitterness
of his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Gilchrist!&rdquo; Preston cried,
&ldquo;are you <i>wanting</i> somebody to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilchrist tried to laugh, and succeeded very badly.&nbsp; He
rose from his chair, knocking a few scattered cigar ashes
carefully off his braided cuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I confess I should not be sorry to see that
prating brat of Bootles&rsquo;s out of the road.&nbsp; We should
perhaps get at the truth then.&rdquo;&nbsp; And <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>having
delivered himself of this feeling speech, he went out, banging
the door after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, upon my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed Preston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the man&rsquo;s got a tile loose in his upper
story,&rdquo; said Hartog, decidedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;No man in his
senses would talk such miserable rot as that.&nbsp; Always
thought Gilchrist a crazy fool myself, but I&rsquo;m sure of it
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how he sticks to it Miss Mignon is Bootles&rsquo;s
own child&mdash;as if it could be any good for him to say she
isn&rsquo;t if she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I shall tell Bootles to keep an eye on
Gilchrist.&nbsp; I say, what a comfort it would be if he would
only exchange!&nbsp; I suppose we can&rsquo;t manage to dazzle
him with the delights of India, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very well.&nbsp; Besides, he lost ever so much
seniority by coming to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s queer, though, he should
be so persistent about Bootles and Miss Mignon.&nbsp; I suppose
he wants to daub Bootles with some of his own mud.&nbsp; Thinks
if he only throws enough, some of it&rsquo;s sure to stick; and
so it would with most men.&nbsp; Happily, however, it don&rsquo;t
in the least matter what a little cad like Gilchrist chooses to
say about a man like Bootles&mdash;a jealous little
beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Neither
of them said any more about the matter, but Hartog took the
earliest opportunity of repeating to Bootles what &ldquo;that ass
Gilchrist&rdquo; had said about seeing that prating brat of
Bootles&rsquo;s out of the road, and in consequence a kind of
watch was set upon the child.&nbsp; Not that Bootles, though he
had a very poor opinion of Gilchrist and Gilchrist&rsquo;s
brains, was afraid for a moment that he would give Miss Mignon
poisoned bonbons, or run off with her and drop her in the river;
yet he did think it not improbable that he might encourage an
already dangerous spirit of adventure, and of course be
absolutely blameless if she could get trampled by a horse&rsquo;s
cruel hoofs, or crushed by one of the many traps going in and out
of barracks.</p>
<p>When Bootles had taken his first long leave after Miss
Mignon&rsquo;s coming, he had left her at Idleminster in charge
of her nurse; but when long leave came round again, and she must
have been about two and a half, he decided to take her with
him.&nbsp; One reason for this was certainly a fear of any pranks
Gilchrist might choose to play, another that Lacy was taking his
leave at the same time, and Bootles was afraid, in the absence of
both, Miss Mignon might fret herself into a fever.&nbsp; And, <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>besides, he
had missed the child during a fortnight&rsquo;s deer-stalking in
Scotland that autumn more than he would have liked to own.</p>
<p>From Blankhampton, therefore, they went to his place, Ferrers
Court, where he was to entertain a rather large party for
Christmas, with a sister of his mother&rsquo;s, and his only near
relative, to do the honors for him, and among his guests a Mrs.
Smith, a widow, and sister to that dead girl to whom he fancied a
resemblance in Miss Mignon.&nbsp; However, at the last moment,
Mrs. Smith wrote to excuse herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very, very sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but a
very dear friend of mine, with whom I spent two winters in Italy,
has suddenly appeared, with a travelling companion and two maids,
to pay me a long-promised visit of at least two months.&nbsp; She
is a Russian countess&mdash;a widow like myself, and wishes, I
fancy, to improve her English, which she already speaks very
well.&nbsp; Of course I am dreadfully disappointed, but cannot
help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it happened that Bootles had a very deep and great respect
and liking for Mrs. Smith, and not for all the widowed countesses
in Russia was he willing to upset his plans; therefore he wrote
off at once to Mrs. Smith, after a five minutes&rsquo; <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>consultation
with Lady Marion, to beg her to carry out her original
intentions, and bring Madame and her retinue
&ldquo;along.&rdquo;&nbsp; Would she telegraph her reply?</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith did so, the reply being, Yes.&nbsp; Moreover, she
supplemented the telegram by a letter, in which she mentioned
among other things that Madame Gourbolska&rsquo;s travelling
companion must be treated in all ways as an ordinary guest.</p>
<p>So, at the time originally appointed for Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s
coming, the party of six&mdash;three ladies and three
maids&mdash;arrived.&nbsp; Bootles himself went to the station to
meet them.&nbsp; He found that Madame Gourbolska was young, not
more than thirty, of the plump and fair Russian type, quite fair
enough to hold her own beside Mrs. Smith, whom he regarded as the
most beautiful woman of his acquaintance.&nbsp; The third lady,
Miss Grace, was fair also, perhaps not so positively beautiful as
either the English or the Russian lady, but fair-haired,
fair-skinned, with soft blue-gray eyes, intensely blue in some
lights, as Bootles noticed directly.&nbsp; Graceful she was to a
degree, and as he watched her move across the little station he
thought how wonderfully her name suited her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith smiled at him as he helped her to <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>mount to the
top of the omnibus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is not the likeness
wonderful?&rdquo; she said, with one of those quick sighs with
which we speak of our dead; and then she said, &ldquo;Poor
Rosy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bootles turned and looked at Miss Grace again, his mind going
back to those dark days, past and gone now, when he and his best
friend had been estranged for honor&rsquo;s sake; when he and
this imperially beautiful woman had stood side by side watching a
young life die out; had together seen the sacrifice of a heart,
the martyr of love to man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is very great,&rdquo; he said, briefly.</p>
<p>That dead sister of Mrs. Smith had always been and would
always be a not-to-be-broken bond of union between them, for the
widow knew how gladly &ldquo;that grand Bootles,&rdquo; as she
always called him, would have tried to make up for the love she
had lost, while to Bootles Mrs. Smith stood out from the rest of
womankind as the sister of the only woman he had ever wished or
asked to marry him.</p>
<p>He helped Miss Grace up to the seat beside Mrs. Smith, and
took his own place beside the Russian lady, who entertained him
very well during the three miles&rsquo; drive between Eagles
Station and Ferrers Court.</p>

In another moment they had drawn up at the great gothic

</div>
</div>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>&ldquo;Oh, but what a paradise!&rdquo; she cried, as the
carriage turned into the court-yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am delighted that it pleases you,&rdquo; he answered,
glancing round to see what effect his ancestral home had upon
Miss Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo; she murmured to Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>In another moment they had drawn up at the great Gothic
door-way, and immediately the figure of a little child dressed in
white appeared on the top of the broad steps, kissing her small
hands in token of welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in directly; you&rsquo;ll get cold.&nbsp; Go in, I
say,&rdquo; Bootles called out.&nbsp; It was, indeed, bitterly
cold, and a few flakes of snow were falling.&nbsp; But Miss
Mignon had a budget of news for her Bootles, and was not to be
done out of telling it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lal has had a letter from home,&rdquo; she piped out in
her shrill voice.&nbsp; Lal was her name for Lacy, and home meant
Blankhampton Barracks.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the St. Bernard has
gotted two puppies&mdash;beauties&mdash;and I&rsquo;m to have
one.&nbsp; Lal says so.&nbsp; And Terry has broked his
leg.&rdquo;&nbsp; Terry was one of Bootles&rsquo;s grooms.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And Major Ally&rsquo;s going to be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bootles was so surprised that he forgot the cold and his order
that Miss Mignon should go in.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;<i>What</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
incredulously.</p>
<p>Just then Lacy himself came to the top of the steps with open
arms, so to speak, and carried off Mrs. Smith into the
house.&nbsp; Miss Mignon took advantage of the opportunity to run
down the steps just as Bootles helped Madame Gourbolska to the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I welcome you with much pleasure,&rdquo; he said,
cordially&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Grace also,&rdquo; as he gave her his
hand to jump the last step.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid you are
tired.&nbsp; You are very white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, not
looking at him, but at the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so bitterly cold.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stand a
moment.&nbsp; Mignon, <i>will</i> you go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mignon skipped up the steps, and the Russian lady caught
her in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you little angel! and what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Miss Mignon.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a very pretty
lady,&rdquo; returned Mignon, critically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wanted
to go to the station, but Bootles said it was too cold, and
Lal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame does not know what Bootles and Lal mean,&rdquo;
interrupted Bootles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Bootles, and that&rsquo;s Lal,&rdquo; Miss
Mignon informed her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Miss Mignon, and I
belong to Bootles.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;Oh, you belong to Bootles.&nbsp; I am sure he
must be very proud of you,&rdquo; Madame answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;m a great bother to him,&rdquo; Miss
Mignon announced, in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<p>Bootles laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come to the fire, Madame,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; Then turning to Miss Grace, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
you are very cold&mdash;you are as white as a ghost.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; addressing Lady Marion, &ldquo;Aunt
Marion, wine would be much better than this tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; tea,&rdquo; they cried&mdash;at least the two
elder ladies, for Miss Grace seemed to have no ears for any one
but the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you speak to me?&rdquo; she asked,
presently, as Miss Mignon gravely regarded her with her big blue
eyes.</p>
<p>Miss Mignon went close to her immediately.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did
Bootles let you drive?&rdquo; she asked, with interest.</p>
<p>Miss Grace shook her head, and lifted Miss Mignon onto her
knee.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not ask him,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, after a pause, &ldquo;I
al&mdash;ways do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not a pair?&rdquo; in surprise.</p>
<p>Miss Mignon nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;When they&rsquo;re not too
fresh.&nbsp; Bootles would have letted you, if you&rsquo;d asked
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;I will another time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lacy,&rdquo; said Bootles, suddenly, &ldquo;is it true
about Allardyce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hartog says so.&nbsp; They say
she&mdash;er&mdash;dwrinks like a duck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;&nbsp; But Bootles laughed as if it was a
great joke, and Mrs. Smith begged to be enlightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t you remember Allardyce?&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s the great military teetotal light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;er&mdash;he wreally is an <span
class="GutSmall">AWFUL</span> duf-fah,&rdquo; remarked Miss
Mignon, in so exact and so unconscious an imitation of
Lacy&rsquo;s drawl that her hearers went off into fits of
laughter, and Miss Grace, clasping her close to her breast, bent,
and kissed the luxuriant golden curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crying,&rdquo; said Miss Mignon, promptly,
scanning Miss Grace&rsquo;s face with her big eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but you made me laugh,&rdquo; she said,
hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people do cry when they laugh,&rdquo; Miss Mignon
informed her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our colonel does.&nbsp; Now Major
Garnet always chokes, and then Bootles thumps him.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; she added, in a tone
of deep concern, &ldquo;if he chokes while we are
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw such an original little piece of <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>mischief in
my life,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Smith.&nbsp; &ldquo;And how charmingly
dressed&mdash;is she not, Madame?&nbsp; So sensible of you to
cover her up with that warm serge up to her throat and down to
her wrists.&nbsp; Who put you up to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy we evolved the idea among us.&nbsp; You see she
runs in and out of my rooms, her own, and Mrs. Gray&rsquo;s, the
adjutant&rsquo;s wife, that is,&rdquo; Bootles answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And barrack corridors are not exactly hot-houses.&nbsp;
Besides, our doctor keeps his eye on her, and he blames the
wrapping-up for her never having a day&rsquo;s
illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in it,&rdquo; asserted Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&mdash;oh! our married ladies tell me I am quite
an authority on the subject.&nbsp; I can tell you we get
fearfully chaffed about her, Lacy and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Miss Grace asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, because she goes about with us a good deal, and
people seem to find the situation difficult to
understand.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took it for granted that she knew all
about Miss Mignon, and she did not press the question
further.&nbsp; But half an hour later, when Mrs. Smith was
thinking of dressing, Miss Grace tapped at her door and
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you lend me a few black pins?&rdquo; she <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Madame and I have both forgotten them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my dear&mdash;take the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Miss Grace only took a few in the pink palm of her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pretty child that is!&rdquo; she said,
carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did the mother die when it was
born?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Smith, &ldquo;she is not
Captain Ferrers&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; No relation
whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&nbsp; Whose, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; That is a question.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she
briefly told Miss Mignon&rsquo;s history, ending: &ldquo;But he
will never part with her now.&nbsp; He is so fond of her, and she
adores him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a fine fellow,&rdquo; said Miss Grace, toying
with the pins in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine fellow!&nbsp; He is a splendid character,&rdquo;
Mrs. Smith cried, warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I assure you I have
studied that man&mdash;and I have known him for years&mdash;and I
<i>cannot</i> find a fault in him.&nbsp; Years ago, when we were
in great trouble, my mother and I, at the time my sister died,
oh, he <i>was</i> so good, so&mdash;well,&rdquo; with a quick
sigh, &ldquo;I cannot explain it all, but he was such a comfort
to us, and she died, poor darling, under very painful
circumstances, especially for me.&nbsp; Oh, there are very few in
the <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>world
like him&mdash;not one in ten thousand.&nbsp; Take his action as
regarded that dear little child, for instance.&nbsp; His brother
officers wanted him to send her to the workhouse, but as he wrote
to me, &lsquo;Some day I may meet the mother, and how should I
face her?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Miss Grace, and Mrs. Smith went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was no small undertaking for a man in his position,
for he has not left her to the entire care of servants&mdash;she
is continually with him and Mr. Lacy, who is also very fond of
her.&nbsp; Do you know, he pays her nurse fifty pounds a
year.&nbsp; In fact, she is just as if she were really his own
child.&nbsp; But it is just like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they would have sent her to the
workhouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One or two of them&mdash;not Mr. Lacy, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grace was silent for a few moments.&nbsp; Then she roused
herself as from a brown-study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am detaining you, Mrs. Smith, and shall be late
myself.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she went
away, passing softly down the corridor, and entered her room,
locking the door behind her.&nbsp; But once in that safe shelter
she flung the pins on the table and dropped upon her knees,
burying her <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>face in her hands, while the scalding tears forced their
way between her fingers, and the great sobs shook her
frame.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Some day he might meet the
mother,&rsquo; she sobbed, &lsquo;and how should he face
her?&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, my child, my little child, how shall I face
him?&nbsp; How shall I bear it?&nbsp; How shall I live in the
same house with him without falling on my knees and blessing him
for saving my little child from&mdash;God knows what?&rdquo;</p>

85</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">month</span> had passed, and the three
ladies still remained at Ferrers Court, though other visitors had
come and gone, lots of them.&nbsp; Lacy was still there also, and
occupied in making desperate love to the Russian lady, utterly
ignoring two important facts&mdash;one that she only laughed at
him, the other that she was three years his senior.</p>
<p>But while all this was going on, Bootles had fallen in love at
last, as men and women only fall once in their lives, and of
course the lady was Madame Gourbolska&rsquo;s friend, Miss
Grace&mdash;had he but known it, the mother of Mignon.</p>
<p>But Bootles never suspected that for a moment.&nbsp; True,
there was a likeness so strong as to proclaim the truth, and many
a time Miss Grace wondered, when she caught sight of the
child&rsquo;s face and her own in a glass, that all these people
did not see it.&nbsp; Yet neither Bootles nor any one else did
see it, and the game of love was played on with desperate
earnestness on his side, and with equally desperate desire to
prevent it on hers.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>But
Bootles admired shy game, and Miss Grace&rsquo;s evident shyness
made him only the more earnest; and not being troubled with that
faint heart which never won fair lady, he had no intention of
allowing Madame Gourbolska to depart from beneath his roof
without asking Miss Grace to return to it as its mistress.&nbsp;
Therefore one afternoon, when he returned from hunting in much
bespattered pink, and went into the fire-lit library, where he
found Miss Grace half dreaming by the fire, he shut the door with
the intention of getting it over at once.&nbsp; Miss Grace rose
with some signs of confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go for a minute,&rdquo; said Bootles;
&ldquo;I want to speak to you.&nbsp; It seems to me that you have
grown very fond of my little Mignon.&nbsp; Is it not
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grace caught at the carvings of the oaken chimney-shelf
to steady herself, and her heart began to beat hard and fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am very fond of her,&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would take her for your own,&rdquo; Bootles
said, very gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For&mdash;my own?&rdquo; sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she thought he knew all, but his next words
undeceived her.</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;If she had such a mother as you, poor little
motherless waif, and if <i>I</i> had such a wife, and if Ferrers
Court had such a mistress!&nbsp; Oh! don&rsquo;t you understand
what I mean?&rdquo; taking her hand.</p>
<p>Miss Grace snatched the hand away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
don&rsquo;t, <i>don&rsquo;t</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">DON&rsquo;T</span>!&rdquo; she said, turning
away.</p>
<p>But Bootles possessed himself of it again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Must I
tell you more?&nbsp; Oh, my darling, how from the very first day
I ever saw you I loved you with all my heart and soul?&nbsp; How,
when I bade you welcome to my house, I could, and would if I had
dared, have taken you up to my heart and kissed you before every
one?&nbsp; How&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell me nothing&mdash;nothing!&rdquo; she cried,
with feverish haste.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand it
cannot be?&nbsp; It is impossible&mdash;quite
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he echoed, blankly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
is it impossible?&nbsp; Not because you don&rsquo;t care, that
I&rsquo;ll swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or, if that is so, look at me and say I don&rsquo;t
love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Miss Grace did not speak, nor yet did she look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or will you tell me that there is some one <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>else whom you
like better?&rdquo; he asked, regaining hope.</p>
<p>No, Miss Grace did not seem inclined to vouchsafe that
information either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or that the care of the child would be an
objection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>!&rdquo; she burst out, in an agonized
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do you mean by impossible?&rdquo; he
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems to me very possible
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him&mdash;that proud, handsome, erect man, with
a smile of expectant happiness on his good face&mdash;and tried
to take her hands away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she sobbed out, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think
I would if I could?&nbsp; I have not been so happy that I would
throw away such happiness as you could give me.&nbsp; Some day
you may know what it costs me to tell you that it is quite
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give me no hope?&rdquo; he asked, in a dull voice,
and she saw that he had grown white to his very lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; she returned; then added, bitterly,
&ldquo;Oh, hope and I have had nothing to say to one another this
long, long while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bootles dropped her hand listlessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then it is
no use my boring you,&rdquo; he said, turning away.</p>

fierce denial rose to the girl&rsquo;s lips, but she choked it
down and suffered his words in silence.&nbsp; Then meekly, and
with one imploring backward look at his tall figure as he stood,
his head well up in spite of his defeat, looking into the fire,
she went away and left him alone.</p>
<h2><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span> it was all over.&nbsp; This was
the end of all his hopes and dreams and wishes!&nbsp; This was
the end!&nbsp; None of his bright hopes would ever be&mdash;none
of his golden dreams would come to pass.&nbsp; His wishes had no
weight with the woman he loved.&nbsp; He had looked
forward&mdash;like a fool, he thought, bitterly&mdash;and had
pictured her in a dozen different ways: at the head of his table,
in the hunting-field, in the middle age, and in the decline of
life, as Mignon&rsquo;s mother, as his wife.&nbsp; But it was all
over now.&nbsp; When Madame&rsquo;s visit was over, she would go
from under his roof, never to come back to it any more,
forever.</p>
<p>He was still standing there when the door opened with some
difficulty, and Miss Mignon appeared on the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bootles?&rdquo; she said, inquiringly.</p>
<p>Bootles turned round to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>Miss Mignon heard the misery in his voice and ran to
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bootles got a headache?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

He dropped into a chair and took her in his arms</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>He
dropped into a chair and took her in his arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such
a headache, Mignon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mignon knew what Bootles&rsquo;s headaches were, and drew
his head down upon her small shoulder with an air of protecting
and comforting dignity, equally pretty and absurd in one so
young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mignon <i>loves</i> Bootles,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Mignon always love Bootles?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; was the confident reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mignon will <i>always</i> love Bootles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so in and because of his trouble the little child crept
closer and closer into his heart, and drove out the greatest
bitterness of his disappointment, and the clasp of her soft arms
about his neck seemed to take away the sharpest sting of
defeat.&nbsp; The touch of her baby lips upon his aching
forehead&mdash;and it <i>did</i> ache&mdash;brought him a larger
measure of comfort than any living thing had power to do at that
moment.</p>
<p>If only he had known that Mignon was <i>her</i> child!</p>
<p>But Bootles was not the man to sulk with fate; if Miss Grace
would not have him, no more was to be said, and no one but Mrs.
Smith saw anything unusual between them.&nbsp; But trust Mrs. <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Smith.&nbsp;
She walked into Miss Grace&rsquo;s room and taxed her with
it&mdash;taxed her in so friendly a way that the girl began to
cry miserably.&nbsp; Mrs. Smith fumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is absurd,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;to refuse such a
man&mdash;such a position&mdash;such&mdash;such&mdash;&nbsp; Oh!
it&rsquo;s absurd.&nbsp; I have no patience with you.&nbsp; You
will never have such a chance again&mdash;never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never,&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, throw it away?&nbsp; Let me go and
tell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; tell him nothing.&nbsp; I have already told him it
is impossible.&nbsp; Oh, Mrs. Smith!&rdquo; she cried,
passionately, &ldquo;do you think any woman in her senses would
refuse him if she could help it?&nbsp; Not I, I assure
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is inexplicable,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith, but she
protested no further.</p>
<p>So the next day they left Ferrers Court, Bootles driving them
to the station.&nbsp; But it was all very different
now&mdash;very different, too, from the last time he had driven
them anywhere.&nbsp; There was no laughter, no joking, no promise
to come again.&nbsp; He was not outwardly angry, not harsh nor
hard in any way, but he was very polite; and politeness from him
was heart-breaking.</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>It was
soon over when they reached the station&mdash;a few minutes of
that kind of conversation which people make when they are waiting
for a carriage or a train, as they said the passengers of the
<i>London</i> made while walking up and down quietly waiting for
the end.&nbsp; There was a handshaking all round, the lifting of
Bootles&rsquo;s and Lacy&rsquo;s hats, a fuss over Miss Mignon,
and that was all.&nbsp; Miss Grace, on looking out of the
carriage window with tear-dimmed eyes, saw that they were
together, the child&rsquo;s hand in his.&nbsp; Miss
Mignon&rsquo;s last words were yet ringing in her ears:
&ldquo;Bootles has gotted such a headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mignon must be very kind to him,&rdquo; Miss Grace
whispered.</p>
<p>Ay, Miss Mignon had need to be kind, for Bootles had
&ldquo;gotted&rdquo; such a heartache too!</p>
<h2><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">crowd</span> of roughs, a lesser crowd
of third-rate spectators, and a lesser gathering of fashionable
ones were assembled on the Blankhampton racecourse, for it was
the day of the Scarlet Lancer Steeple-chases.</p>
<p>On the Grand Stand were to be seen most of the rank and
fashion of the neighborhood, and a goodly show of that class of
people who are always to be found about towns which are also
military stations&mdash;the class of people who have daughters to
marry, and not much money to marry them with.</p>
<p>There were all the Scarlet Lancer ladies in full force, from
the colonel&rsquo;s wife in blue velvet and sables, to the
quartermaster&rsquo;s lady in a hard felt hat, with long diamond
and pearl ear-rings.&nbsp; There were officers in cords and
boots, their silken finery hidden by Newmarket coats.&nbsp; And
there was the bride, Mrs. Allardyce, in pink and gray, the
major&rsquo;s racing colors&mdash;oh lor! as the fellows said
when <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>they
saw her.&nbsp; And there was Miss Mignon, a little three-year-old
belle, got up in Bootles&rsquo;s colors&mdash;scarlet, purple,
and gold&mdash;adapted in her small case to a warm frock of
purple velvet, braided with scarlet and gold, and on her golden
curls a jockey-cap to match it.&nbsp; Utterly absurd, most people
said, but Bootles didn&rsquo;t seem to see it.&nbsp; Nor, for the
matter of that, did Miss Mignon herself.&nbsp; Held by Bootles,
or, when Bootles was riding, by Lacy, she sat on the broad ledge
of the balcony and surveyed the world, like a queen in
miniature.</p>
<p>It was a fine place for seeing; yes, and a fine place for
hearing too, as Lacy testified afterwards in his own peculiar
style of delivery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;I and Miss Mignon were waiting for Bootles to
come down the lawn, when&mdash;er&mdash;a laday next to
us&mdash;er&mdash;a little unpwrepossessing person&mdash;I found
out afterwards that her name is Berwry&mdash;with a nose like a
teapot-spout, and a mouth of the bull-dog ordah&mdash;little
daughter, by-the-bye, pretty much of the same type, but just a
shade less hideous&mdash;suddenly electwrified us by pulling out
a huge pair of gold eye-glasses, and holding the wrace-card at
arm&rsquo;s-length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ow!&rsquo; said she, in a mincing voice, when
Miles <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>came down the lane looking like a sack of flour in a
purple satin jacket&mdash;&lsquo;Ow, <span
class="smcap">Cap</span>-tain Ferwrahs!&nbsp; Ow, Dorothy, my
deah, <span class="smcap">Cap</span>-tain Ferwrahs!&nbsp;
<i>Vewry</i> handsome&mdash;and how <i>beau</i>-tifully he
wrides!&nbsp; Ow, I&rsquo;m shaw he&rsquo;ll win, and what a
<i>lovely</i> horse!&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Cap</span>-tain
Ferwrahs!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s vewry handsome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;I gave Miss Mignon a gwreat squeeze
to hold her tongue&mdash;and she did.&nbsp; This
Mrs.&mdash;er&mdash;Berwry went on expatiating on Miles&rsquo;s
great beauty of person, and on the absolute certainty of his
winning.&nbsp; &lsquo;And his pet name is Bootles,&rsquo; she
informed us.&nbsp; His <i>pet</i> name!&nbsp; Well, pwresently
Bootles came sailing down the lawn in all his glowry, and Miss
Mignon quite forgot the old girl, and shouted out to him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bootles,&rsquo; she
called&mdash;&lsquo;Bootles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bootles glanced up, and waved his hand,
and&mdash;er&mdash;the old party called Berwry turned wound and
eyed her sharply, saw the scarlet, purple, and gold of her
dwress, looked at her card, and said, witheringly, &lsquo;Ow, I
don&rsquo;t know <i>him</i>,&rsquo; as if there were a dozen
Captain Ferwers knocking about, and this was one of the eleven
she didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when the wrace was over&mdash;er&mdash;who should
come up but Miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, Miles,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;heard a laday <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>expatiating just now on your
extrwreme beauty and gwrace and elegance of person&mdash;was shaw
you&rsquo;d win.&nbsp; What a pity you didn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bless my soul!&rsquo; said Miles; &lsquo;was she
pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be flattered; she took you for
Bootles,&rsquo; said I, ignoring the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bootles&rsquo;s money again!&rsquo; cwried
Miles, with a gwreat wroar of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in two twos up comes Bootles.&nbsp; &lsquo;See me
win, Mignon?&rsquo;&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&mdash;er&mdash;told him the stowry too, and
Bootles laughed that absurd &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; of his.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come along and have some lunch, Mignon, my
sweetheart,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;<i>and let&rsquo;s be out of
this</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was after this incident that the most important event
of that bright May day occurred&mdash;one of those fearful
struggles to win, when half a dozen horses show well for the
post, and all the field finds tongue and shouts its hardest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ferrers wins!&nbsp; Blue and fawn&mdash;yellow and
black!&nbsp; Miles wins&mdash;Miles wins!&nbsp; No, no; Ferrers
in front&mdash;fawn and blue!&nbsp;
Hartog&mdash;Hartog&mdash;Hartog wins!&nbsp; Miles in
front!&nbsp; Ah, he&rsquo;s down!&nbsp;
Ferrers&mdash;Miles&mdash;blue and fawn&mdash;Gilchrist
gains&mdash;Miles&mdash;Gilchrist&mdash;Ferrers
wins&mdash;Ferrers wins!&nbsp; All up with the others!&nbsp;
Ferrers <span class="GutSmall">WINS</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>And
then the company, good, bad, and indifferent, had time to
remember that a man was down&mdash;no, not one man, but
two.&nbsp; To find out that Hartog was bruised and stunned, but
able with help to get to the dressing-room and recover himself,
to learn that the swarming crowd around the other was watching a
more exciting race than that which they had just witnessed with
shouts and applause, that they were watching with awe and in
silence a race between life and death&mdash;for Gilchrist, the
&ldquo;odd&rdquo; man of the regiment, the man who had been
nobody&rsquo;s friend, nobody&rsquo;s chum, was lying in the
midst of them with his back broken, waiting for a hurdle.</p>
<p>They were all as sorry as men could be who had never been
moved by feelings of friendship.&nbsp; The proceedings were
stopped at once, and they went gravely back to barracks, those
who had ridden, to get into morning-clothes, and all of them to
hang about waiting for news.</p>
<p>But there was no hope, absolutely no hope whatever.&nbsp; With
all his faults, failings, and peculiarities, Gavor Gilchrist was
passing away from their midst by exchange, as Hartog had once
wished&mdash;the exchange, not of one regiment for another, but
of this world for the next.</p>

<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>It
was about six o&rsquo;clock that the senior of the two surgeons
in attendance on Gilchrist entered the anteroom, and, looking
around, beckoned for Bootles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo; asked several voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t last the night.&nbsp; Bootles, he wants
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Bootles, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure to want Bootles,&rdquo; observed Preston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I should myself,&rdquo; returned another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t last the night,&rdquo; remarked a
third.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I never did like Gilchrist&mdash;never;
but, all the same, I&rsquo;m deuced sorry for him now, poor
chap.&nbsp; For oh, by Jove! it&rsquo;s a fearful thing when you
come to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then they fell into silence again, waiting for Bootles to
come back.&nbsp; Half an hour passed&mdash;three-quarters; then
Bootles did not come.&nbsp; An hour; then Bootles
appeared&mdash;came with a white face and a scared look in his
blue eyes, followed by the doctor who had fetched him.&nbsp;
Every man in the room was roused from a lounging attitude to one
of expectation and surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bootles,&rdquo; said Lacy, moving towards him.</p>
<p>But Bootles did not even look at him.&nbsp; He turned to the
doctor and uttered words the like of which <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>none of his
hearers had ever heard from him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kept my temper, doctor&mdash;you think I did?&nbsp; I
know the man&rsquo;s dying.&nbsp; Yes, I know, and I
shouldn&rsquo;t like to think I lost my temper with a poor chap
who was dying, but&mdash;but&mdash;No; I won&rsquo;t say a
word.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go away and keep to myself until
I&rsquo;ve got over it a little.&nbsp; If I stop here I shall say
something I shall be sorry for all the rest of my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Bootles?&rdquo; broke in Lacy, in his soft
voice.</p>
<p>But Bootles did not reply for a moment.&nbsp; He stood still,
trying hard to control himself; but Lacy, who had laid his hand
upon his sleeve, felt that he was shaking from head to foot, and
his very lips were trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; said Lacy, persuasively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is Mignon&rsquo;s father!&rdquo; Bootles
answered.&nbsp; And then he broke from Lacy&rsquo;s grasp and
fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Lacy cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; it is true,&rdquo; the doctor
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is making his will now, leaving Bootles
sole guardian and trustee to the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brute,&rdquo; burst out Preston, indignantly,
remembering Gilchrist&rsquo;s words&mdash;not so long ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one word&mdash;of reproach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he seen her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; He would not, though Bootles asked

<p>&ldquo;His own child&mdash;and she Miss Mignon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better.&nbsp; She cannot endure him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&nbsp; But what a blow for Bootles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will he take it?&nbsp; Will it make any
difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As wregards Miss Mignon?&nbsp; What wrot you
talk.&nbsp; As if Bootles&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But there Lacy
broke off in disgust, and the babel of surmises, questions, and
answers went on.</p>
<p>And that night Gavor Gilchrist died.</p>
<h2><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Oh</span>, but it was a blow for
Bootles!&nbsp; To find he had been duped, tricked, made a fool of
all this time; to remember the anxiety, the trouble, the expense
to which he had been put; nay, to recall the chaff he had
endured, and then to discover that Miss Mignon was
Gilchrist&rsquo;s child&mdash;the child of the man he went
perhaps nearer to hating than any one he had ever known in all
his life!&nbsp; Everything came back to him then&mdash;the dead
man&rsquo;s jibes and sneers and taunts, his unwearied efforts to
tax him with an offence which he knew he had not committed.&nbsp;
And though he had failed in that, oh, what a fool Gilchrist had
made of him!&nbsp; That was the sting Bootles felt most of
anything.</p>
<p>For hours after he left the anteroom Bootles kept out of every
one&rsquo;s way&mdash;indeed until Lacy came to tell him that
Gilchrist was dead.&nbsp; Then, it being close upon the hour of
eleven, he went and knocked at the door of Mignon&rsquo;s
nursery.&nbsp; The nurse opened it a few inches, and seeing who
it was, set it open wide.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&ldquo;Is Miss Mignon asleep?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; hours ago,&rdquo; the woman answered.</p>
<p>He passed into the inner room, where the child was
lying.&nbsp; A candle burned on a table beside the cot, casting
its light on the fair baby face, now flushed in sleep, and on the
tangled golden curls.&nbsp; Both her arms lay outside the eider
coverlet, one hand grasping the whip with which he had ridden and
won that day, the other holding the card of the races.&nbsp;
Bootles bent and scanned her face closely, but not one trace
could he discern of likeness to the father&mdash;not
one&mdash;and he drew a deep breath of relief that it was so.</p>
<p>Well he remembered Lacy&rsquo;s puzzled scrutiny of the
year-old baby.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a likeness, but I
don&rsquo;t know where to plant it.&rdquo;&nbsp; If there had
been a likeness to Gilchrist then, it had now passed away; and as
Bootles satisfied himself that it was so, his love for her, which
during the last few hours had hung trembling in the balance,
though he would hardly have acknowledged it, even to himself,
re-asserted itself, and rose up in his heart stronger than
ever.&nbsp; Just then she moved uneasily in her sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lal, where <i>is</i> Bootles?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;
Then, after a pause, &ldquo;Gotted <i>another</i>
headache?&rdquo;&nbsp; And <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>an instant later, &ldquo;Miss Grace
said Mignon was to be very kind to Bootles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bootles bent down and kissed her, and she awoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bootles,&rdquo; she said, in sleepy surprise; then,
imperatively, &ldquo;Take me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Bootles carried her to the fire in the adjoining room,
where the nurse was sewing a fresh frill of lace on the pretty
velvet frock, with its braidings of scarlet and gold, which she
had worn that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lal said Mignon wasn&rsquo;t to go to Bootles,&rdquo;
she said, reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bootles has been bothered, Mignon,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Bootles!&rdquo; stroking his cheek with her soft
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bootles was vexed; Lal said so.&nbsp; But not
with Mignon.&nbsp; Mignon told Lal so,&rdquo; confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never with Mignon,&rdquo; answered Bootles, resting his
cheek against the tossed golden curls, and feeling as if he had
done this faithful baby heart a moral injustice by his hours of
anger and doubt.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, broken by the nurse.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you heard, sir, how Mr. Gilchrist is?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Bootles roused himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is dead,
nurse.&nbsp; Died half an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if you please, sir,&rdquo; she asked,
hesitatingly, &ldquo;might I ask if it is true about Miss
Mignon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is true,&rdquo; his face darkening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, sir, Miss Mignon should have mourning,&rdquo;
she began, when Bootles cut her short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not allow her to wear mourning for Mr.
Gilchrist,&rdquo; he said, curtly; so the nurse dared say no
more.</p>
<p>Three days later the funeral took place; and if the facts of
the dead man&rsquo;s having acknowledged Miss Mignon as his
child, and having admitted to Bootles that he had transferred her
that night from his own quarters to Bootles&rsquo;s rooms,
created a sensation, it was as nothing to the intense surprise
caused by the will, which was read, by the dead man&rsquo;s
desire, before all the officers of the regiment.</p>
<p>In it he left his entire property to his daughter, Mary
Gilchrist, now in the care of Captain Ferrers, and commonly known
as Mignon, on condition that Captain Ferrers consented to be her
sole guardian and trustee until she had attained the age of
twenty-one, or until her marriage, provided <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>it should
be with her guardian&rsquo;s sanction, and on the express
understanding that Captain Ferrers should not give up the care of
the child to her mother, even temporarily.&nbsp; To his wife,
Helen Gilchrist, a copy of this testament was to be sent
forthwith.&nbsp; Should any of the conditions be violated, the
whole property of which he died possessed should go to his
cousin, Lucian Gavor Gilchrist; but if the conditions be
faithfully observed Captain Ferrers should have the power of
applying any, or all, of the income arising from the estate for
the use and maintenance of the said Mary Gilchrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cwrazy!&rdquo; murmured Lacy to Bootles, who listened
in contemptuous silence, and wondered in no small dismay what
kind of a life he should have if Mignon&rsquo;s mother chose to
make herself objectionable.</p>
<p>But the will was not crazy at all; far from it.&nbsp; It was
only a very cleverly thought-out plan for keeping mother and
child apart.&nbsp; Bootles would take care not to endanger
Mignon&rsquo;s inheritance, and Gilchrist had taken advantage of
it to carry out his animosity towards his wife to the bitter
end.</p>
<p>But of course there was one contingency he had never thought
of or provided for&mdash;<i>marriage</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>It
was less than a week after Gilchrist&rsquo;s death that Bootles
received a note by hand, signed Helen Gilchrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already!&rdquo; he groaned, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I trouble you to send the child to see me for half
an hour during this afternoon?&rdquo; she said, and that was
all.</p>
<p>But Bootles did not see sending the child to be quietly stolen
away.&nbsp; He forgot quite that since Gilchrist had not left his
widow a farthing she would probably be now no better able to
provide for the child than she had been when compelled to cast
her baby upon the father&rsquo;s mercy.&nbsp; Therefore,
immediately after lunch, he drove down to the hotel from which
the note had been written.&nbsp; Yes; Mrs. Gilchrist was
within&mdash;this way.&nbsp; And then&mdash;then&mdash;Bootles,
with the child fast holding his hand, was shown into a room, and
there they found&mdash;<i>Miss Grace</i>!</p>
<p>The truth flashed into his mind instantly.&nbsp; She rose
hurriedly, and he saw that she was clad in black, but was not in
widow&rsquo;s dress.&nbsp; She fell upon her knees and almost
smothered Mignon with kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mignon!&nbsp; Mignon!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mignon has been very kind to Bootles,&rdquo; <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Mignon
explained, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Mignon! my baby!&rdquo; the mother sobbed.&nbsp;
Bootles watched them&mdash;the two things he loved best on
earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you nothing to say to me?&rdquo; he asked at
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I say?&rdquo;&nbsp; She had risen from her
knees, and now moved shyly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might say,&rdquo; said Bootles, severely,
&ldquo;that you are very sorry that you, a married woman,
deceived me and stole my heart away.&nbsp; You might say that,
for one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not sorry,&rdquo; cried Mignon&rsquo;s mother,
audaciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you might take a leaf out of Mignon&rsquo;s book,
and say, as she says when I have a headache, &lsquo;Mignon
<i>loves</i> Bootles.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

it.&nbsp; But only think of that poor devil spending his last

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
